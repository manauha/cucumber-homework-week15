  In Order to perform successful Login
  As a Admin
  I should verify different scenarios for login

  Background: User is on login page
    Given I am on login page

    When I login to the application
    And I navigate to the Home page
    Then I get a message "Dashboard"

  Scenario: User should see the logo on homepage successfully
    When I login to the application
    And I navigate to the Home page

  Scenario: User should logout successfully
    When I login to the application
    And I navigate to the Home page
    And I click on user profile logo
    And I click on log out button
    And I logout successfully
    Then I should get a text "Login"

  Scenario Outline: User should get error message for invalid credentials
    And I enter an user "<username>"
    And I enter a password "<password>"
    And I click on login Button
